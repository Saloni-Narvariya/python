     Does age play a role?
      since it's probable that children were saved first.
      
      Another variable that could influence survival is age; 
      since it's probable that children were saved first.

      You can test this by creating a new column with a categorical variable Child. 
      Child will take the value 1 in cases where age is less than 18, 
      and a value of 0 in cases where age is greater than or equal to 18.
 
      Then assign the value 0 to observations where the passenger 
      is greater than or equal to 18 years in the new Child column.
      Compare the normalized survival rates for those who are <18 and 
      those who are older. 
    
      To add this new variable you need to do two things
        1.     create a new column, and
        2.     Provide the values for each observation (i.e., row) based on the age of the passenger.
